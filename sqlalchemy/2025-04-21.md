# SQLAlchemy Core and Set Operations

## What is SQLAlchemy Core?

SQLAlchemy Core is a part of the SQLAlchemy library in Python. It helps us work with databases using SQL-like commands in Python.

It is not object-oriented like SQLAlchemy ORM. Instead, it works directly with tables and columns, similar to writing real SQL queries.

With SQLAlchemy Core:
- You can connect to a database.
- You can create tables.
- You can write queries using Python code.
- You can insert, update, delete, and read data.

## What are Set Operations?

Set operations are used to combine the results of two queries.

The main set operations are:
- `UNION`
- `INTERSECT`
- `EXCEPT`
