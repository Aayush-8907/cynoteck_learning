## 1. UNION

### What it does:
- Combines the results of two queries.
- Removes duplicate rows.
- Returns only unique results from both queries.

### Example in simple terms:
If Query 1 gives: `['A', 'B']`  
and Query 2 gives: `['B', 'C']`  
then UNION will return: `['A', 'B', 'C']`

---

## 2. INTERSECT

### What it does:
- Returns only the rows that are in both queries.
- Removes anything that is not common in both results.

### Example:
If Query 1 gives: `['A', 'B']`  
and Query 2 gives: `['B', 'C']`  
then INTERSECT will return: `['B']`

---

## 3. EXCEPT

### What it does:
- Takes the result of the first query.
- Removes the rows that are also in the second query.
- Only the unique rows from the first query remain.

### Example:
If Query 1 gives: `['A']`  
and Query 2 gives: `['B']`  
then EXCEPT will return: `['A']`

Note: In SQLAlchemy, we write `except_()` with an underscore. This is because `except` is a keyword in Python.
