## How Messaging Works in Meta API?

### 1. Business-Initiated Messages
- When a business sends the first message, it must use a **Template Message**.
- Templates require **approval** from Meta.
- Without an approved template, businesses cannot initiate conversations.

### 2. User-Initiated Messages
- If a customer messages first, businesses can reply with **any type** of message.
- No template approval needed for replies.
- Businesses can respond freely within a **24-hour window** from the customer's message.
