### SupplySync RM Notes

#### 1. Overview

- **What it is**: SupplySync RM is a software that helps manufacturers buy raw materials (like steel) cheaper and easier.
- **How it works**:
    - Manufacturers tell the system what they need (e.g., 200kg steel).
    - It combines their needs into one big order (e.g., 1000kg).
    - Suppliers offer prices, and the system picks the best one.
- **Tools**: Uses WhatsApp and a company messaging system (IMS) to talk to people.
- **AI**: A smart computer (AI) does the hard work like understanding messages and finding the best deals.
- **Dashboard**: A screen shows updates for customers and suppliers (orders, payments, etc.).
- **Goal**: Save money by buying in bulk (e.g., ₹50/kg instead of ₹60/kg).

**Example**: Three manufacturers need 200kg, 300kg, and 500kg steel. System makes it 1000kg, gets a cheaper price, saves 17%.

#### 2. System Architecture

- **Communication Channels**:
    - **WhatsApp**: Manufacturers text “Need 200kg steel” or suppliers reply with prices. Easy, no app needed.
    - **IMS**: A company chat app with a form to fill (e.g., 200kg steel, Mumbai). More organized.
- **Database Interaction**:
    - Manufacturers send needs via WhatsApp, IMS, or another software (e.g., “Low on steel”).
    - AI understands it, saves it in a database (like a big filing box).
    - Dashboard shows everything (orders, shipments).
- **Key Parts**:
    - AI: Understands messages, combines orders, picks suppliers.
    - Database: Stores all info.
    - Logistics: Tracks steel delivery.

#### 3. Workflow

**How the system works step-by-step**:

##### 3.1 Demand Aggregation

- **What**: Combines manufacturers’ needs into one big order.
- **How**:
    - Manufacturers say what they want:
        - Software: “200kg steel” (automatic).
        - WhatsApp: “Need 200kg steel.”
        - IMS: Fill a form or type “200kg steel.”
    - AI understands it, checks it’s okay, and groups similar needs (e.g., 200kg + 300kg + 500kg = 1000kg steel, Mumbai).
- **Result**: “1000kg steel by April 15.” Tells manufacturers: “Your order is in a big group—save money!”

##### 3.2 Demand Broadcasting

- **What**: Sends the big order to suppliers.
- **How**:
    - System says: “Need 1000kg steel by April 15” via WhatsApp or IMS.
    - Suppliers reply:
        - Supplier X: “800kg at ₹50/kg, 3 days.”
        - Supplier Y: “1000kg at ₹52/kg, 4 days.”
    - AI reads replies, scores them (price, speed, amount).
- **Result**: Saves supplier offers in the database.

##### 3.3 Supplier Selection and Allocation

- **What**: Picks the best supplier and gives steel to manufacturers.
- **How**:
    - AI compares:
        - Supplier Y: ₹52,000 for 1000kg, 4 days.
        - Supplier X: ₹40,000 for 800kg, 3 days.
    - Picks Supplier Y (full 1000kg).
    - Splits it:
        - Customer A: 200kg.
        - Customer B: 300kg.
        - Customer C: 500kg.
    - Tells them: “Your 200kg from Supplier Y at ₹52/kg. Okay?”
- **Result**: Supplier Y wins, steel assigned.

##### 3.4 Transaction Finalization

- **What**: Finishes the deal—payment and delivery.
- **How**:
    - Manufacturers say “Yes” to their share (200kg, 300kg, 500kg).
    - Supplier Y says “Yes” to 1000kg.
    - Payment:
        - A: ₹10,400, B: ₹15,600, C: ₹26,000 = ₹52,000 total.
    - Supplier ships 1000kg to Mumbai hub, then split to factories.
    - Updates: “Your 200kg shipped—track here.”
- **Result**: ₹52,000 paid, 1000kg delivered by April 15.
