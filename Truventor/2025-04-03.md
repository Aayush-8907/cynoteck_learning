### One-Way Messaging (Business-Initiated)

- Business sends a message **first**
- **Requires a WhatsApp-approved template**
- Used for OTPs, alerts, confirmations, promotions

**Reference:** [Message Templates](https://www.twilio.com/docs/whatsapp/tutorial/send-whatsapp-notification-messages-templates)


#### Example (One-Way Template Message):
```
"Hello {{1}}, your order #{{2}} has been shipped. Track it here: {{3}}."
```

### Two-Way Messaging (Customer-Initiated)

- Customers send a message **first**
- Business can **reply freely** within **24 hours**
- No template approval needed for replies
- Used for **customer support, inquiries, live chat**

#### Example (Two-Way Chat):
```
Customer: "Where is my order?"
Business: "Hey! Your order is on the way. Track it here: [link]"
```

**Important:** If the business wants to send the first message in a two-way conversation, it is considered **business-initiated** and **requires an approved template.**
