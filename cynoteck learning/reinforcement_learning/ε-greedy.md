The **ε-greedy algorithm** is a strategy used in **reinforcement learning** to balance **exploration** (trying new actions) and **exploitation** (choosing the best-known action). It helps the agent learn effectively by trying out new actions at first, then focusing on the best action as it gains more experience.

### **How ε-Greedy Works:**

- **ϵ\epsilonϵ** is a parameter between 0 and 1 that controls the balance between exploration and exploitation:
    - **Exploration**: With probability ϵ\epsilonϵ, the agent **takes a random action** to explore the environment.
    - **Exploitation**: With probability 1−ϵ1 - \epsilon1−ϵ, the agent **chooses the best-known action** based on current knowledge.

### **Steps:**

1. **Start with high ϵ\epsilonϵ** (close to 1) to encourage exploration.
2. **Gradually decrease ϵ\epsilonϵ** over time to reduce exploration and focus on exploitation.
3. **End with ϵ\epsilonϵ close to 0**, where the agent mostly exploits the best-known action.
