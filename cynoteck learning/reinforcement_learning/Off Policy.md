The agent can explore multiple strategies, and even if it doesn't try them every time, it learns the best possible actions. It doesn't have to follow the same actions from day to day.

### **Off-Policy Learning Example**:

1. The agent (car) might still park the car by going left to the parking space, but this time, **while exploring**, it might try parking **in a different way** (e.g., reverse instead of forward).
2. Even if the car parks in the reverse direction, it is **learning** not only from **its own actions** but also from **the best possible actions** (e.g., "What would be the best way to park, whether forward or reverse?").
3. The car doesn't necessarily have to park in the same way every day. The **off-policy agent** can try different strategies (like reverse parking) and still update its knowledge based on **the best possible actions**, even if the agent didn't try those actions directly during exploration.
4. So, on the next day, the agent could choose to park **forward or reverse** depending on the optimal strategy it is learning, **not necessarily based on what it did yesterday**.
