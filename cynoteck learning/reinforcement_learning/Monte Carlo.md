Monte Carlo methods are used in **model-free reinforcement learning**. The key idea is that the agent learns by **sampling complete episodes** (from start to finish) and calculating the **total reward** at the end of each episode. It **doesn't need a model of the environment** (no transition probabilities or predefined dynamics).

### **How Monte Carlo Works (Simple Explanation)**

- **Explore the environment** by taking random actions.
- Complete the **entire episode** (reach the goal or fail).
- After the episode ends, **calculate the total reward** for the sequence of actions taken.
- **Update the value of states or actions** based on the actual rewards received.

Monte Carlo helps the agent learn **which actions lead to better rewards** by **averaging the rewards** over multiple episodes.

### **Example (Monte Carlo in a Grid World)**

Imagine the same grid world:



`1  2  5 ` 

`3  4  6`  

- The goal is to reach **state 4** and get a reward of **+10**.
- Each move costs **-1**.

**Monte Carlo Process:**

1. **Episode 1:**  
    The agent takes random actions and reaches **state 4** after this path: 1→2→5→6→41 → 2 → 5 → 6 → 41→2→5→6→4.
    - Total reward for this episode: −1−1−1−1+10=+6-1 - 1 - 1 - 1 + 10 = +6−1−1−1−1+10=+6.
2. **Episode 2:**  
    The agent tries another path: 1→3→41 → 3 → 41→3→4.
    - Total reward for this episode: −1−1+10=+8-1 - 1 + 10 = +8−1−1+10=+8.

**After multiple episodes**, Monte Carlo will learn that the **1→3→41 → 3 → 41→3→4** path is better because it gives a higher reward on average.

### Summary:

- **Monte Carlo = Learn by sampling entire episodes** (no model required).
- **Model-Free**: It doesn’t predict future states; it just learns from experience.
- **Updates values at the end of each episode** based on the actual rewards received.
- **Good for episodic tasks** like playing games, where you can observe the full outcome.
