### Docker Architecture:

![[docker architecture.png]]

Docker follows a **client-server architecture**, where the **Docker Client** sends requests to the **Docker Daemon (dockerd)**, which processes them using **Images** and **Containers**, often pulling from **Registries**. Let’s break it down with the additional points:

#### Key Components

1. **Docker Client**
    - The user interface (CLI) that sends commands (e.g., docker run python:3.11) to the Docker Daemon via a REST API.
    - It’s how you interact with Docker, passing requests and receiving responses.
2. **Docker Daemon (dockerd)**
    - The "brain" of Docker, responsible for handling all requests. It manages:
        - **Images**: Building, pulling, and storing them.
        - **Containers**: Creating, running, and stopping them.
        - Networking, storage, and other Docker resources.
3. **Docker Images**
    - A **Docker Image** is a lightweight, read-only template that contains everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, libraries, dependencies, and configuration.
    - Think of it as a "snapshot" or blueprint. For example, the python:3.11 image includes Python 3.11 and its core libraries.
    - Images are built (via a Dockerfile) or pulled from a registry and stored locally by the daemon.
    - Key Point: Images are immutable—once created, they don’t change. To modify an image, you build a new one.
4. **Docker Containers**
    - A **Docker Container** is a running instance of an image. It’s an isolated, executable environment created from an image.
    - When you run docker run python:3.11, the daemon takes the python:3.11 image, creates a container, and starts it.
    - Containers are ephemeral by default—stopping them discards changes unless you save them (e.g., via docker commit).
    - Key Point: Containers add a writable layer on top of the read-only image, allowing runtime changes (e.g., temporary files).
5. **Docker Registries**/ Hub
    - Storage for Docker Images, where the daemon pulls images from or pushes images to.
    - **Public Registries** (e.g., Docker Hub): Host widely-used images like python:3.11.
    - **Private Registries**: Store custom images for specific projects or organizations.
### How It All Works Together

Here’s the complete flow using your example (docker run python:3.11):

1. **Docker Client Sends Request**: You type docker run python:3.11, and the client sends it to the daemon.
2. **Docker Daemon Processes the Request**:
    - Checks if the **image** (python:3.11) exists locally.
    - If not, pulls it from the **registry** (Docker Hub).
    - Uses the **image** to create a **container**.
    - Starts the **container** and executes the default command (e.g., a Python shell).
3. **Response Sent**: The daemon sends the container’s output back to the client, which you see on your screen.
