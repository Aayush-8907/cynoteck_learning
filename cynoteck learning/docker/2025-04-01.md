## What is Docker? 

- Docker is an **open-source centralized platform** used to **create, deploy, and run applications**. 
- Docker uses **containers** on the host operating system (OS) to run applications.
- It lets applications use the **same Linux kernel** as the system on the host computer, instead of creating a whole virtual OS. 
- We can install Docker on **any OS**, but the Docker engine runs natively on a **Linux distribution**.
- Docker is written in the **Go** language.
- Docker is a tool that does **OS-level virtualisation**, also called **containerization**.

## History and Purpose  
- Docker was first released in **March 2013**. 
- It was developed by **Solomon Hykes** and **Sebastien Pahl**. 
- Docker is a set of **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** tools. 
- It uses **OS-level virtualization**, while virtual machines (VMs) use **hardware-level virtualization**. 
- Before Docker, many users had a problem: code would run on the **developer’s system** but not on the **user’s system**.
